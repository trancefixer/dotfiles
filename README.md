# homedir
home directory config files

These are some home directory files that I have honed over the decades, and decided to finally share.
I think they've proven useful and stable enough that they should work in most Unix environments.
You will see old stuff in here.  Do not be surprised to see mention of SunOS and AIX.

I'm starting with my shell startup scripts and will gradually add more.

I hope you can benefit from all the work that went into these.
